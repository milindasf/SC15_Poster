  Space Filling Curves (SFC) are commonly used by the HPC community for partitioning data\cite{campbell2003,devine2005,sundar2007} and for resource allocations\cite{bender51,slurm}. Amongst the various SFCs, Hilbert curves have been found to be in general superior to the more ubiquitous Morton or Z-Curve \cite{campbell2003}. However, their adoption in large-scale HPC codes, especially for partitioning applications, has not been as common as Morton curves due to the computational complexity associated with the Hilbert ordering. In this work, we present an alternative algorithm for computing the Hilbert ordering that can be implemented almost as efficiently as the Morton ordering. Additionally, being based on the concept of the {\em nearest common ancestor}---a fundamental property of all SFCs---the algorithm can be applied to all SFCs. We also present a small modification to the standard SFC based partitioning algorithm that allows us to obtain significant improvements in part
 ition quality while using Hilbert ordering.
%We also present comparisons of Morton and Hilbert curve based partitions for adaptive meshes using two partitioning schemes demonstrating the superiority of Hilbert ordering.

\section{Introduction}

Load balancing and partitioning are critical when it comes to parallel computations. Generally partitioning involves the tasks of equally dividing the work and data among the processors,
reducing processor idle time and the communication costs. 
% Partitioning can be done statically or dynamically.
In this research we are focused on developing an efficient flexible dynamic
partitioning scheme, based on the Hilbert curve, targeted at adaptive-mesh computations. 

As we march towards exascale machines, the cost of data movement and load-imbalances therein are a major bottleneck for achieving scalability. We consider an alternative SFC-based partitioning scheme where we allow some (user-specified) flexibility in the work assignment, so as to minizmize the data-dependencies across partitions. Effectively, we allow the flexibility in minimizing the communication load-imbalance at the cost of a marginal increase in work load-imbalance. The traditional SFC-based partitioning can be recovered by setting the flexibility to zero.  

One of the main advantage of SFC based partitioning is the
preservation of geometric locality of objects between processors. Depending on the SFC (i.e. Morton, Moore, Hilbert) that used for partitioning, the amount of locality preserved differs \cite{bader2012}. 
Most of the SFC based partitioning use the Morton curve which is good for current range of clusters in terms of giving good load balance and the efficiency of the implementation. But as we focus on larger levels of parallelism, we show that Hilbert is more effective. Recursive computation of Hilbert ordering can be inefficient, which can lead to low performance in overall computation.
In this paper we present an approach based on Nearest Common Ancestor (NCA) which can be extended to calculate any SFC ordering efficiently. Considering the results we gathered we can show that
the Hilbert ordering based on NCA, is 9 times faster than the traditional recursive approach. 
%and it scales better. %{\bf Add: and Scales better}

%\section{Methodology}

\section{Nearest Common Ancestor (NCA) based ordering}
SFC is a surjective mapping between the one dimensional space to higher dimensional space. 
% Generally almost all the SFC adhere to the recursive nature in curve generation. 
Due to the recursive nature SFCs have, most of the SFCs can be computed recursively. In this paper we present an algorithm to compute Hilbert ordering based on the NCA which is 9 times faster than the recursive approach.
The main advantage of the NCA based Hilbert order calculation is the extensibility of the algorithm to other SFCs. 
% Using the NCA property, any SFC ordering can be easily computed.
The key idea is to find the NCA for the given coordinates (see Fig. \ref{NCA} ,Fig.\ref{zcell} \& Fig.\ref{hilbertcell}).  Next we need to figure out the ordering within the NCA element. This might be fixed as in the case of Morton ordering, or might require a traversal from the root of the tree to the NCA, as in the case of Hilbert. 
%Since the rotation pattern in fine cell depends on the rotation patterns of more coarse cells (i.e in Hilbert curve) we traverse the octree from root to NCA once figuring out the rotation pattern inside the NCA. 

% Even though there are multiple SFCs available, 
%We mainly focus on the Morton and Hilbert curves and their ordering computations. 
To compare the NCA based ordering approach with other approaches we have
implemented both Hilbert and Morton ordering as follows: a) baseline (recursive) Hilbert implementation, b) baseline Morton implementation \cite{sundar2007}, c) new NCA-based Hilbert, and d) NCA-based Morton implementation for comparison. 
%\begin{itemize}
% \item Hilbert ordering baseline implementation (based on recursive approach)
% \item Morton ordering baseline implementation (based on non-recursive approach (i.e current implementation in dendro\cite{sundar2007}))
% \item Hilbert ordering NCA implementation (based on NCA approach)
% \item Morton ordering NCA implementation (based on NCA )
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Allowing flexibility in dynamic load balancing}

As mentioned earlier most of the partitioning schemes are focused on uniform distribution of tasks across all the processor. The main drawback of this approach is, the uniform-work load balancing can cause
imbalance in the communication load, slowing down the overall computation. In this paper we introduce some flexibility to the load balancing in order to reduce the overall communication
costs. 
% and reduce the overall execution time of the computation. 
To demonstrate the above claim we conduct two experiments.
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard SFC based partition, where the work is uniform across all processes and compare the communication (using the surface area of the partition as a surrogate)
\item A flexible SFC based partition, where we allow a small 'slack' (at most $10\%$ of $N/p$) in the amount of work that each process gets in order to reduce the communication costs. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

Baseline and NCA based Hilbert and Morton ordering algorithms are executed with varying maximum depth for sorting one million (2D \& 3D) points. 
% In this context maximum depth refers to the maximum height of the octree needed to compute the Hilbert or Morton ordering. 
Each implementation of the Hilbert and Morton ordering executed twenty times and mean executing time in milliseconds is taken as the performance measure.
Fig.\ref{2d_NCA} \& Fig.\ref{3d_NCA} depict the 2D and 3D Hilbert and Morton ordering performance for different implementations. All the SFC implementations are run in Intel Xeon E7-4820v2 CPU @2.00 GHz (32 cores) processor
with 64 GB DDR3 RAM and using the g++ 4.8 compiler in the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS environment. 
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item {\bf convert this to a single sentence instead of itemized}
%  \item Intel Xeon E7-4820v2 CPU @2.00 GHz (32 cores)
%  \item RAM: 64 GB DDR3
%  \item OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
%  \item Compiler: g++ 4.8
% \end{itemize}

% {\bf 1-2 sentences summarizing the results of fig 2d and 3d. Also 1 sentence concluding.} 
According to the Fig.\ref{2d_NCA} \& \ref{3d_NCA}, we can see that the execution time of recursive approach resides in the range of 10s to 40s, while the execution time of the NCA approach
is less than 3s (in 2D implementation) and 4.5s (in 3D implementation). 
% If we consider the Morton baseline and Morton NCA implementations, we can see that Morton NCA implementation is outperformed by the Morton baseline implementation when the maximum depth parameter exceeds 7 (in 2D implementation) and 4 (in 3D implementation). 
In the average case, Morton NCA and Morton baseline performances are very close to each other. Our results suggest that the NCA based Hilbert ordering is 9 times faster (mean performance) than the traditional recursive Hilbert
ordering and the NCA property can be used to calculate the ordering of a generic SFC efficiently.

In the second experiment we allow some flexibility to the load, and observe how contour ratio (ratio between the surface area of the mesh that each node gets with flexibility, Vs 0 flexibility case)
behaves with Hilbert and Morton ordering based partitioning. Our results show that (see Fig.\ref{flexibility}) by using the Hilbert ordering we can achieve low contour ratios compared with the Morton ordering which implies low
communication costs.
% We can conclude that by using Hilbert ordering with some flexibility we can reduce communication costs further compared to the Morton ordering (even with some flexibility).

\section*{Conclusions}

In this work we presented a faster algorithm for computing the ordering of SFCs, specifically the Hilbert curve. We also demonstrated the improvement in partitioning quality by allowing for non-uniform assignment of work. Future work will focus on testing this for larger clusters and actual communication costs. 


%\begin{itemize}
%\item Hilbert ordering is better than Morton ordering in terms of preserving the geometric locality of objects. 
%\item We can conclude that the NCA based Hilbert ordering algorithm is 9 times faster than the traditional recursive approach for Hilbert ordering. 
% \item NCA based algorithm is easily extensible to compute the ordering of any generic SFC (i.e. Morton, Peano etc.)
%\item Allowing some flexibility to the load at each node can reduce the communication further  (approximately in the range of 1.125-1.175 times), and reduce the overall computation time.
