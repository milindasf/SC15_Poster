1. Morton is good for current range of clusters in terms of giving good load balance, but as we focus on larger levels of parallelism, Hilbert will be more effective.
2. We conduct 2 experiments, demonstrating this:
   1) Standard SFC based partition, where the work is uniform across all processes and compare the communication (using the surface area of the partition as a surrogate)
   2) a flexible SFC based partition, where we allow a small 'slack' (flexibility) in the amount of work that each process gets. This means that all processes will not have the (~)same amount of work, with the objective of further reducing the communication costs.
3. Since, current implementations of Hilbert curve computations are expensive, we propose a new algorithm that works for all SFC using the property of the NCA.
4. We show results for our efficient implementation.
