# Optimized way to calculate the rotation pattern of the NCA
	#This includes the Hilbert ordering calculation based on the ordering. 
	#How can we limit the number of rotations in hilbert curve.

# Include new optimzed run times in the poster. 

# New experimental results Surface to Volume ratios

# Update on the reviwer comments. 

#Ask Hari to can we use some real world applicatiopns.
